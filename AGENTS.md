# Auto Best template instructions

This is the authoritative reusable master: darkapoparka/cars-template-auto-best. The current user request determines scope. Preserve the existing rendered design unless the requested shared improvement changes it.

## Task routing

- Shared template frontend/code work: work here, keep changes reusable, and read only the relevant architecture/style/QA reference.
- Dealer build or correction: use canonical clients/<slug>/ in [Cars](https://github.com/darkapoparka/cars), through its workflow. Do not personalize this master.
- Template release: follow [Cars integration](docs/CARS-INTEGRATION.md); promotion selects an exact reviewed commit and leaves existing dealers independent.
- Audit/status: inspect without edits or publication unless fixes are requested.

Read [TEMPLATE](TEMPLATE.md) for runtime/content boundaries and [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) when verification needs it. [Cars integration](docs/CARS-INTEGRATION.md) owns the cross-repository contract. Do not load every historical task ledger or resume its backlog.

## Implementation and preservation

Confirm physical checkout, remote, current branch/HEAD, relevant dirty paths and listener ownership. One writer owns the checkout/index/build output. Preserve unrelated staged, unstaged, untracked and unique branch work; no blanket staging, clean/reset, branch deletion or force-push. Keep existing lockfiles, runtime, licenses and provenance. Do not switch a working branch or overwrite a Cars snapshot merely to synchronize it.

Use Node 22.12+ on the 22 line and the retained npm lockfile. Keep source ownership at `src/lib/config/brand.ts`, `src/lib/config/template.ts`, `src/lib/data/`, `src/lib/styles/tokens.css`, `static/`. Reuse actual components and data boundaries. Preserve the existing route and interaction contracts.

Check the changed behavior at relevant mobile/desktop widths and run proportionate existing checks. A full source release needs exact-commit evidence; a local success or prior audit does not prove mounted/public behavior. Forms are demos until real delivery is configured and verified. Do not contact leads.

Commit only reviewed task-owned changes when authorized. Template polish does not authorize dealer deployment. Report changed paths/commit, actual checks, preserved work and remaining limits. Workflow command/compatibility changes update their authoritative references and relevant tests together.
