# Testing reference

Tests cover different layers: source/type checks, domain logic, runtime media, build output and real browser behavior. This document explains the available commands; it is not a claim that every suite currently passes.

## Package commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Vite development server |
| `npm run build` | SvelteKit/Vite production build |
| `npm run preview` | Serve built output locally |
| `npm run check` | SvelteKit synchronization and Svelte/TypeScript diagnostics |
| <code>npm run check:architecture</code> | Native source architecture checks |
| <code>npm run check:css-policy</code> | Reject fragile selectors, invalid standalone-CSS <code>:global(...)</code>, and dealer artwork/palette leakage |
| `npm run check:tokens` | Validate token aliases, reference cycles, source usage and shared control-height overrides |
| `npm run check:typography` | Reject local typography values outside the shared token owner |
| `npm run smoke:typography` | Current Sell/Import flows, entry tabs, action hierarchy and clipped controls at 320/390/768/1440px |
| `npm run smoke:phase4` | Phase 4 discovery-draft, shell/navigation, focus, return-state and breakpoint contracts |
| `npm run check:assets` | Static media and source-reference checks |
| `npm run validate` | Architecture, CSS policy, tokens, typography, assets and domain checks followed by Svelte/type check and build |
| `npm run quality` | Combined validation and browser suite chain |
| `npm run smoke` | Route/journey, enquiry and discovery browser suites |
| `npm run check:domain` | Inventory, filter and journey/domain assertions |

The exact command definitions are in [package.json](../package.json). `quality` composes existing scripts rather than starting the application server itself.

## Typical development checks

```sh
npm run check:css-policy
npm run check:tokens
npm run check
npm run check:domain
npm run check:assets
npm run build
```

`validate` combines the static/domain/build stages defined in the package. Architecture checks examine native application boundaries; CSS policy checks enforce semantic selectors and centralized dealer theme ownership; token checks verify the shared reference graph and component aliases; asset checks compare public media with references; domain checks exercise actual TypeScript domain functions rather than separately reimplementing them.

The standalone `check` script currently uses `--threshold error`; warnings are not automatically equivalent to a failed warning-free check. To inspect stricter diagnostics explicitly, run `npx svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json --fail-on-warnings` after synchronization. Its `quality` chain is validation followed by smoke.

## Browser setup

Start the intended server in one terminal. In another, set `BASE_URL` and run the suite:

```powershell
$env:BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:6461"
npm run smoke
```

Or in a POSIX shell:

```sh
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6461 npm run smoke
```

For the built preview, use that preview URL instead. `scripts/browser.mjs` controls the browser channel/executable and target URL. [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md) describes the environment options.

## Browser suite responsibilities

| Script | Main behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/sveltekit-smoke.mjs` | Entry point for native route and journey coverage |
| `scripts/route-smoke.mjs` | Routes/status codes, images, page errors, overflow and responsive layout |
| `scripts/journey-smoke.mjs` | Listing/article returns, vehicle contact context, discovery and menu interaction |
| `scripts/enquiry-smoke.mjs` | Enquiry entry, steps, review, local photos and sharing/copy behavior |
| `scripts/mobile-filter-smoke.mjs` | Bulgarian returning-visitor filter draft, nested choices, application, empty results and result-label containment |
| `scripts/mobile-polish-smoke.mjs` | Bulgarian/English mobile actions, icon size, single-line mobile inventory titles, filter footer, detail touch targets, short-viewport editors and configured settings title |
| `scripts/desktop-discovery-smoke.mjs` | Desktop discovery and sticky-control behavior |
| `scripts/phase4-smoke.mjs` | URL/filter preservation, nested and outer draft ownership, pending desktop values, shell transitions, menu focus, duplicate IDs and 767/768/991/992 boundaries |
| `scripts/typography-smoke.mjs` | Entry/segment/CTA hierarchy, keyboard tab switching, link/VIN/description editor save and discard, stable card height, sell/import validation and review, reference edits and clearing, manual fallback, copied text, Escape/focus return, control reflow and screenshots |

Additional mobile/accessibility/resilience and visual-comparison tools exist in the newer local working source but are not package scripts in this standalone baseline. Do not assume a fresh clone includes them.

## Focused mobile polish checks

With `BASE_URL` set to the current build, run `node scripts/mobile-polish-smoke.mjs`. It covers 320, 390, 430 and 1440px in Bulgarian and English. The filter suite and this focused suite set explicit returning-visitor preferences; first-visit prompt behavior belongs to `scripts/qa-locale-preferences.mjs`. The mobile checks inspect control geometry as well as document overflow, because clipped labels and shrinking icons can occur without widening the page. Generated screenshots and results are saved under `artifacts/mobile-polish-smoke/`.

## Phase 4 regression contract

`npm run smoke` now includes `npm run smoke:phase4`. The focused suite uses the same `BASE_URL`, browser helper and artifact reporting conventions as the existing route, journey, enquiry, mobile-filter and desktop-discovery suites.

It verifies sort and chip changes without dropping unrelated URL state; nested picker Apply/Cancel versus outer dialog Apply/Cancel; deterministic make/model reset; Home desktop pending values; filtered inventory → detail → anchored return; direct and client-side route presentation; contact-topic and menu active state; detail mobile actions; footer/mobile-dock/detail-bar transitions; focus restoration; desktop mega-menu keyboard ownership; duplicate IDs; horizontal overflow; and explicit 320, 390, 430, 767/768, 844-landscape, 991/992, 1024, 1440 and 1920 boundaries.

The domain suite exercises parser/serializer round trips for every public listing key, draft conversion, equipment-array isolation, malformed/zero/whitespace/safe-integer numbers, make/model reset and preservation, facet URL preservation, chip labels, sort behavior and safe return context using the real TypeScript modules.

Phase 4 visual qualification compares production previews of the exact parent and implementation commits with fonts loaded, reduced motion and stable scroll position. Its committed result is documented in [the architecture execution ledger](ARCHITECTURE-REFACTOR-PLAN.md#phase-4-implementation-record--15-september-2026); generated screenshots and JSON reports remain under ignored `artifacts/`.

Reports/screenshots generated by the active scripts are written under `artifacts/`. Inspect the named failure and the corresponding source. An old report is not the result of the current run; a screenshot alone does not establish that a form, redirect or keyboard flow works.

## Practical browser scenarios

`node scripts/desktop-routes-smoke.mjs` checks Home, Inventory, About, Blog and
general Contact in Bulgarian and English at 992, 1024, 1440 and 1920px, plus a
390px regression pass. Set `BASE_URL` first. It verifies equal 540px desktop
heroes, About-only scene requests, responsive cutout loading and search clearance,
title/description/control separation, real Onest
glyph rendering (including Cyrillic), visible images, page overflow and runtime
errors. It warms lazy images before saving full-page 1440px/390px captures under
`artifacts/desktop-routes-smoke/`. Search, filter drafts, sticky controls, keyboard
focus and article return behavior remain covered by desktop-discovery and journey
suites. See [desktop route audit](DESKTOP-ROUTE-AUDIT.md) for the styling contract.

Use 390px and 1440px as the primary mobile/desktop pair. Add 320px and 430px for narrow mobile behavior, 768px/991px/992px for layout transitions, and a wide viewport for hero artwork. Use the same viewport, browser, loaded fonts and scroll position for visual comparisons.

| Area | Exercise |
| --- | --- |
| Home | Search, Buy/Import mode, service links, body/brand expansion and video action |
| Inventory | Query, make/model dependency, range values, equipment, sorting and zero matches |
| Filter dialogs | Open nested choices, cancel, apply, close and return focus |
| Detail | Data/description/equipment tabs, contact actions, finance and return to filtered stock |
| Sell/import | Invalid and valid input, back/edit, review, photo removal, copy/share and cancellation |
| Editorial | Search/category, article opening, related links and filtered return |
| Shell | Mobile menu, desktop mega menu, keyboard navigation and footer/dock behavior |
| HTTP | Known pages, invalid IDs, redirects, robots and sitemap |

Check that content does not disappear behind fixed mobile actions, that a closed dialog releases page scrolling, and that each important link retains its intended destination. Missing-image and provider-failure scenarios are useful for client deployment, but a mocked provider test does not verify the provider itself.

## Updating tests with components

Prefer accessible roles/names for meaningful interactions and stable component selectors for layout-specific checks. When a component is renamed or split, update its tests to exercise the same behavior. Avoid treating a stale selector as proof that the application is broken, or removing the assertion merely because it fails.

The standalone source and current working preview have different enquiry/finance implementations; select the actual component for the tested revision. [Components](COMPONENTS.md) records that distinction.

## Documentation-only changes

Check relative file links, headings, code paths and npm script names against the checkout. Ensure examples describe implemented APIs and Markdown is UTF-8. Application screenshots and a production rebuild are unnecessary when the diff changes only documentation and no build inputs.

Current cross-repository ownership, approved releases, dealer-copy workflow and standalone/mounted limits: [Cars integration](CARS-INTEGRATION.md).

## Native locale release checks

`npm run check:locales` verifies deterministic catalog output. `npm run check:locale-source` audits literal rendered/accessibility copy and static key/alias calls. `npm run test:locales` includes compiler, policy, source-audit and negative fixtures. Both catalog and source audits run before a production build.

With `BASE_URL` set to an owned built preview, `npm run smoke:locales` runs the EN/BG route, HTTP, legacy, preference, storage, race, journey and completion suites serially. `scripts/run-locale-qa.mjs` supports named output labels and explicit suite selection. Source snapshots and logs distinguish tested source from later edits; see [localization coverage](localization/COVERAGE.md).

The existing discovery/enquiry suites use `locale-smoke-fixture.mjs` to seed a returning Bulgarian visitor; first-visit behavior is independently tested by the locale suites. They retain their original behavioral assertions while accepting native localized URL prefixes and current control copy. General smoke success does not replace EN/BG or public-deployment acceptance.

## Overlay control regression checks

Run `node scripts/check-overlay.mjs` for scroll-lock release order, duplicate cleanup and exact scroll restoration. With `BASE_URL` set to the intended local preview, run `node scripts/overlay-controls-smoke.mjs`; run again with `OVERLAY_ENGINE=webkit` for the installed WebKit engine. Missing browsers are errors, not silent skips.

The matrix covers BG/EN at 320, 390, 430, 768 and 1440px, with short 420px viewports for form/filter controls. It checks the token-derived 44px interaction shell and 40px visible circle, SVG centering within 0.5 CSS pixels, native appearance, icon size, reachable Close/Save actions, nested dialog dismissal, focus return and discarded editor drafts. Existing route, discovery, enquiry, phase4, typography and localization suites remain separate. Desktop Chrome and Windows WebKit emulation do not replace physical iOS/Android keyboard and safe-area testing.
