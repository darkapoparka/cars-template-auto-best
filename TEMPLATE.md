## Main configuration

`src/lib/config/brand.ts` contains names, logo, phone, address and social destinations. `src/lib/config/template.ts` contains preview/published mode, canonical origin, identity/inventory verification flags and optional team/partner sections. Design tokens live in `src/lib/styles/tokens.css`.

These are code-level configuration modules. There is no admin panel, universal theme JSON or one-switch localization system. Headlines, service artwork and some campaign copy live with their components or feature data; [Reuse](REUSE_GUIDE.md) and [Components](docs/COMPONENTS.md) identify them.

## Defaults that matter when copying

The template starts in preview/noindex mode. Sample team and partner sections are disabled. Vehicle records are sample data unless explicitly verified by the implementation. The brand name does not make the existing phone, map, social accounts, video selection or inventory generic.

A client copy retains the application structure and changes its content and relevant imagery. A template version should be identified by its actual source commit, not an old date embedded in an inherited manifest. Historical `.template` records describe acquisition/copy operations rather than an application release service.

## Source and working preview

The standalone repository owns future shared improvements. The earlier Cars preview at J:/cars/templates/auto-best contains separately preserved refinements; compare and reconcile them before promoting a release. A listener or documentation update does not synchronize either copy. See [Cars integration](docs/CARS-INTEGRATION.md).
